# WRDS Stock Ranking Query System High-Level Design

## Design Objective

The goal of this document is to provide detailed guidance and  specification for the development of the WRDS Stock Ranking Query System. WRDS Stock Ranking Query System is a subsystem of the WRDS Stock Ranking System that consists of a data ingestion system and a query system. The design objective of whole system is to recommend stocks and to help users forming their own strategies based on a set of stock ranking factors. While the data ingestion system handles data ingestion and calculation, this subsystem is primary responsible for providing views and queries of stock rankings to users. This document includes many aspects of the system, including architecture, data models, factor specification,

## Background

The Stock Ranking system, hereinafter referred to as "the System," represents a crucial tool for investors and financial professionals seeking to make data-driven investment decisions. The System is designed to efficiently collect, process, and analyze a vast amount of financial data, including historical stock prices, market indicators, and various financial metrics. This background section provides an overview of the motivations and context driving the development of the System.

### Motivation

In today's rapidly evolving financial markets, the ability to make informed investment decisions is paramount. Access to comprehensive and accurate financial data is essential for investors to identify trends, assess risk, and seize opportunities. Traditional data processing and analysis methods often struggle to handle the ever-increasing volume of financial data generated daily. As a result, there is a growing need for a robust and high-performance financial analysis system that can efficiently process and analyze large datasets to support investment strategies.

### **Context**

The System is being developed in response to the challenges and opportunities presented by the financial industry. With the advent of online trading platforms, algorithmic trading, and the democratization of financial information, investors and financial professionals are increasingly relying on technology to gain a competitive edge in the market. However, these technological advancements also pose the challenge of handling massive datasets while ensuring data accuracy, integrity, and availability.

To address these challenges, the System leverages the Hadoop ecosystem  like Hive and Spark for OLAP workloads. The Hadoop ecosystem provides mature component to support data intensive usecases, allowing the System to provide users with timely and actionable insights for investment decision-making.

## Overview

This document aims to analyze the platform and give a tentative breakdown of each of its components. It starts with analyzing problem requirements and then breaks down the platform step by step. A couple of solutions will be discussed for sub-components, which will be analyzed later in more specific designs. Finally, a road map will be provided for this project.

- **Stock Pool Selector:** Provides a user interface for selecting predefined pools of stocks or for creating custom pools based on user-defined criteria.
- **Ranking Panel:** Displays the results of stock rankings based on selected factors and conditions. Users can sort, filter, and analyze the ranking results.
- **Portfolio Tracker:** Tracks the performance of user portfolios over time and provides insights into gains, losses, and other relevant metrics.
- **Account Management:** Manages user accounts, including authentication, authorization, preferences, and settings.

**API Gateway:**

- Serves as an entry point for the web application, routing requests to the appropriate services in the application layer and aggregating the results for the web app.

**Application Layer:**

- **Factor Manager:** Manages the lifecycle of ranking factors, including creation, update, and deletion of factor definitions.
- **Stock Ranker:** Processes ranking requests by applying factors and conditions to generate a ranked list of stocks.
- **Stock Pool Manager:** Manages the different pools of stocks, including their creation, update, and deletion based on defined criteria.
- **Portfolio Manager:** Handles operations related to portfolio management, including tracking performance and managing portfolio compositions.

**Domains:**

- **Factor Domain:** Contains the business logic related to ranking factors and their management.
  In the Factor Domain, the aggregate could be designed to manage the lifecycle and rules around the factors used for stock ranking. An aggregate in this context would typically include the factor definitions along with the rules and logic for how factors are created, updated, and applied. Here is a potential design for a Factor Domain aggregate:

  **FactorAggregate:**

  **Root Entity: Factor**

  - **Identifier:** Unique identifier for the factor (e.g., factor ID).
  - **Name:** The name of the factor, which would be recognized by users and within the system.
  - **Description:** A detailed description of what the factor represents and how it is calculated.
  - **Expression:** The formula or computation expression used to calculate the factor's value.
  - **Metadata:** Additional information about the factor, such as its data sources, update frequency, and applicability.

  **Value Objects:**

  - **FactorMetadata:** Encapsulates all metadata related to the factor, including tags, category, and creation date.
  - **FactorValue:** Represents the calculated value of a factor for a given stock at a specific point in time.
  - **FactorFormula:** An object that defines the computational logic for the factor, possibly including references to other factors.

  **Entities:**

  - **FactorDependency:** Represents other factors or inputs that the current factor depends on for its calculation.

  **Services:**

  - **FactorCalculationService:** A domain service that takes in a stock or set of stocks and computes the value of the factor for each one.
  - **FactorValidationService:** Validates the expression/formula of the factor to ensure that it is logically and mathematically correct.

  **Repositories:**

  - **FactorRepository:** Manages the persistence of Factor aggregates, providing the ability to retrieve, update, and store factors.

  **Domain Events:**

  - **FactorCreated:** An event indicating that a new factor has been defined and is now available for use.
  - **FactorUpdated:** An event signaling that a factor has been modified, which could potentially trigger re-calculation of rankings that use this factor.
  - **FactorDeleted:** An event that denotes the removal of a factor from the system.

  **Example Scenario:**
  When a user defines a new factor, the system would instantiate a new `Factor` entity as the root of the `FactorAggregate`. The `FactorCalculationService` could be invoked to test the calculation expression, ensuring that it is valid and executable. The `Factor` entity would be populated with its `Name`, `Description`, `Expression`, and `Metadata`. The `FactorRepository` would then be used to persist the new factor. The creation of the factor would also raise a `FactorCreated` domain event, which other parts of the system might listen to in order to update their own state or perform further operations, such as recalculating stock rankings if necessary.
- **Ranker Domain:** Encapsulates the logic for the ranking process, including the application of algorithms and factor weightings.

  - Aggregate
    - RankingProcess
      - Represent the state and progress of a ranking task
      - Fields
        - **ID**
        - **State**: Pending, In-Progress, Completed
        - **Parameters**: Includes all the parameters necessary for the ranking (e.g., selected factors, weights, and conditions).
        - **Result:** The outcome of the ranking process, typically a list of ranked stocks with their scores.
      - supported operations

        - get_state
        - cancel
        - get_result
  - Entities
    * **RankedStock:** Represents a single stock within a ranking, including its score and any relevant details specific to the ranking.
    * **RankingFactor:** Represents a factor used in the ranking process. It includes the factor definition and its weight.
  - Value Objects
    * **FactorScore:** A value representing the score of a stock for a particular factor.
    * **RankingCriteria:** A set of conditions and rules that define how the ranking is performed.
  - **Repositories:**
    - **RankingProcessRepository:** A repository responsible for persisting and retrieving RankingProcess aggregates.
  - **Domain Events:**
    - **RankingInitiated:** An event indicating that the ranking process has started.
    - **RankingCompleted:** An event indicating that the ranking process has been completed, and the results are available.
  - **Example Scenario**:
    - When a user requests a stock ranking, the application service would create a new RankingProcess entity and set it as the root of the RankingAggregate. It would then use the RankingCalculator to compute the scores of stocks based on the provided RankingCriteria. As the calculation proceeds, RankedStock entities would be created and associated with the RankingProcess. Once the process is completed, the RankingCompleted event would be published, and the results would be persisted using the RankingProcessRepository.
- **Stock Domain:** Represents the domain logic for managing stock-related information, such as stock details, price history, and metadata.

  **StockAggregate:**

  **Root Entity: Stock**

  **Repositories:**

  - **StockRepository:** Responsible for persisting and retrieving Stock aggregates. This would handle CRUD operations and queries related to stock entities.

  **Domain Events:**

  - **StockPriceUpdated:** An event that is raised when the price of a stock is updated.
  - **FinancialsUpdated:** An event that is raised when new financial information for a stock is available.

  **Example Scenario:**
  A user or automated system requests the latest information on a stock. The `StockUpdateService` retrieves real-time data from an external source, updating the `Stock`'s `Current Metrics` and `Price History`. The `StockValuationService` may then compute real-time valuation metrics based on the new data. Once the updates are made, the `StockPriceUpdated` event is published, which could trigger other parts of the system, such as the Stock Ranker, to re-evaluate rankings that include this stock. The `StockRepository` is used throughout to retrieve and persist changes to the Stock aggregate.

  **Domain Events:**

  - **StockAddedToPortfolio:** An event raised when a new stock is added to the portfolio.
  - **StockRemovedFromPortfolio:** An event raised when a stock is removed from the portfolio.
  - **PortfolioRebalanced:** An event raised when the portfolio is rebalanced, signaling that holdings have been adjusted to meet the desired asset allocation.

  **Example Scenario:**
  When a user decides to rebalance their portfolio, the `InvestmentPortfolio` initiates a rebalancing operation. The `PortfolioValuationService` recalculates the value of the portfolio, while the `PerformanceAnalysisService` updates performance metrics. Transactions are generated for each buy and sell operation, and the `Holdings` are updated accordingly. As each transaction is processed, corresponding events such as `StockAddedToPortfolio` or `StockRemovedFromPortfolio` are published. Once the rebalancing is complete, a `PortfolioRebalanced` event is raised. The `PortfolioRepository` is then used to save the new state of the `InvestmentPortfolio`.

## Database Design

The query system chooses **PostgreSQL** and its time-series supporting variant **TimescaleDB** as primary databases. Trade-offs and reasons behind this decision will be discussed in the database trade-off section.

### Table Design

#### Relational Database Design (SQL)

For structured data that requires ACID transactions, like user accounts, portfolio holdings, and factor definitions.

**Users Table**

- UserID (Primary Key)
- Username
- HashedPassword
- Email
- CreatedAt
- LastLogin

**Portfolios Table**

- PortfolioID (Primary Key)
- UserID (Foreign Key)
- Name
- Description
- CreatedAt

**Holdings Table**

- HoldingID (Primary Key)
- PortfolioID (Foreign Key)
- StockID (Foreign Key)
- Quantity
- PurchasePrice
- PurchaseDate

**Stocks Table**

- StockID (Primary Key)
- TickerSymbol
- CompanyName
- MarketCap
- Sector
- Industry

**Factors Table**

- FactorID (Primary Key)
- Name
- Description
- Expression
- CreatedAt
- UpdatedAt

**Transactions Table**

- TransactionID (Primary Key)
- PortfolioID (Foreign Key)
- StockID (Foreign Key)
- TransactionType (Buy/Sell)
- Quantity
- PriceAtTransaction
- TransactionDate

**StockFactors Table** (Associative table for many-to-many relationship between Stocks and Factors)

- StockID (Foreign Key)
- FactorID (Foreign Key)
- Value
- Timestamp

#### Time-Series Database Design (NoSQL)

For storing and querying time-series data such as stock prices, which require high write throughput and fast reads over time range queries.

**StockPriceTimeSeries**

- StockID (Link to Stocks Table)
- DateTime (Timestamp)
- OpenPrice
- ClosePrice
- HighPrice
- LowPrice
- Volume

### Cache Layer (In-Memory Data Store)

For fast access to frequently read data, such as the latest stock rankings or user sessions.

**RankingCache**

- RankingID
- Stocks (List with ranking order)
- Timestamp

**SessionStore**

- SessionID
- UserID
- Expiry

### Message Queue (For Asynchronous Processing)

To handle asynchronous tasks such as updating stock prices or processing user transactions, which do not require immediate consistency.

**TaskQueue**

- TaskID
- Type (UpdatePrice, ProcessTransaction)
- Payload (JSON)

### Considerations:

- **Scalability:** The system should be designed to scale horizontally, especially for the time-series and document stores, which will handle the bulk of the data.
- **Performance:** Indexes should be strategically used, especially in the relational database, to speed up queries, and the time-series database should be optimized for fast writes and range queries.
- **Normalization:** The relational data should be normalized to reduce redundancy, but some denormalization might be acceptable in the time-series and document stores for performance reasons.
- **Security:** Sensitive data like user passwords should be hashed, and access to the databases should be controlled with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Data Integrity:** Foreign keys, constraints, and transactions in the relational database ensure data integrity for critical operations.

### Trade-offs

Choosing the appropriate database for an application involves considering various trade-offs in terms of features, performance, scalability, and operational complexity. For a stock ranking system, we need databases that can handle time-series data effectively. The combination of Postgres and TimescaleDB our proposed choice, with TimescaleDB being an extension to Postgres that is specifically optimized for time-series data. This enables simpler infrastructure design and the ease of maintainance, while still benefiting from the time-series supporting features.

- **Performance and Specialization:** ClickHouse and DolphinDB may offer better performance for analytics workloads and time-series data, but may require more specialized knowledge to set up and maintain.
- **Scalability:** If horizontal scalability is a primary concern, HBase or ClickHouse may be more appropriate, though they come with additional complexity.
- **Operational Complexity:** Managing a combination of different types of databases (e.g., PostgreSQL for relational data and TimescaleDB for time-series data) can add to the operational burden.
- **Community and Support:** PostgreSQL has a large and active community, which can be a significant factor when considering support and troubleshooting.

## Stock Ranking Factors Specification

In stock ranking and analysis, there are several fundamental factors that investors often use to evaluate and compare stocks. Here are some of the most commonly used factors along with explanations of how they are calculated:

#### Financial Ratios

##### 1. Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)

The P/E ratio compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share (EPS).

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{P/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Stock Price}}{\text{Earnings Per Share (EPS)}}
$$

- **Stock Price:** The current market price of a single share.
- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):** The company's profit divided by the outstanding shares of its common stock. It can be for the past 12 months (trailing P/E) or for the forecasted next 12 months (forward P/E).

##### 2. Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B)

The P/B ratio compares a company's stock price to its book value per share.

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{P/B Ratio} = \frac{\text{Stock Price}}{\text{Book Value Per Share}}
$$

- **Stock Price:** The current market price of a single share.
- **Book Value Per Share:** The net asset value of a company divided by the number of outstanding shares.

##### 3. Dividend Yield

Dividend yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price.

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividends Per Share}}{\text{Stock Price}}
$$

- **Annual Dividends Per Share:** The total dividends paid out over a year, divided by the number of outstanding shares.
- **Stock Price:** The current market price of a single share.

##### 4. Earnings Growth

Earnings growth is the annual compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of earnings from investments.

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{Earnings Growth} = \left( \frac{\text{EPS in Current Year}}{\text{EPS in Previous Year}} \right)^{\frac{1}{\text{Number of Years}}} - 1
$$

- **EPS in Current Year:** The company's EPS for the most recent fiscal year.
- **EPS in Previous Year:** The company's EPS from the previous fiscal year.

##### 5. Return on Equity (ROE)

ROE measures a corporation's profitability by revealing how much profit a company generates with the money shareholders have invested.

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{ROE} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Shareholder's Equity}}
$$

- **Net Income:** The profit of the company after taxes, interest, and other expenses.
- **Shareholder's Equity:** The assets of the company minus its liabilities.

##### 6. Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E)

The D/E ratio is used to measure a company's financial leverage and is calculated by dividing a company's total liabilities by its shareholder equity.

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{D/E Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Shareholder's Equity}}
$$

- **Total Liabilities:** All of a company's short-term and long-term obligations.
- **Shareholder's Equity:** The assets of the company minus its liabilities.

##### 7. Beta

Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market.

**Calculation:**
Typically, beta is calculated using regression analysis against a market index like the S&P 500.

$$
\text{Beta} = \frac{\text{Covariance}(\text{Stock Returns}, \text{Market Returns})}{\text{Variance}(\text{Market Returns})}
$$

- **Covariance:** Measures how changes in a stock's returns are associated with changes in the market's returns.
- **Variance:** Measures the dispersion of the market's returns.

##### 8. Operating Margin

Operating margin is a margin ratio used to measure a company's pricing strategy and operating efficiency.

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{Operating Margin} = \frac{\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Revenue}}
$$

- **Operating Income:** Also known as operating profit, it is the profit realized from a business's operations.
- **Revenue:** The total amount of income generated by the sale of goods or services related to the company's primary operations.

When calculating these factors, analysts often source the required financial data from the company's financial statements: the income statement, the balance sheet, and the statement of cash flows. It's important to note that these factors should be used as part of a broader analysis, considering both quantitative and qualitative aspects of a company's operations and market position.

#### Technical Indicators

Technical factors, also known as technical indicators, are used primarily for analyzing stock price movement and trading volumes. They are a key component of technical analysis, which attempts to predict future market behavior based on past market performance data. Here are some common technical factors and how they are calculated:

### 1. Moving Average (MA)

A moving average smooths out price data to create a single flowing line, making it easier to identify the direction of the trend.

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{Moving Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of Closing Prices over 'n' periods}}{n}
$$

- **Closing Prices:** The closing prices of the stock for each period within the moving average window.
- **n:** The number of periods over which the average is calculated (e.g., 20-day, 50-day, 200-day).

### 2. Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)

MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a stockâ€™s price.

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{MACD} = \text{EMA}_{\text{fast}} - \text{EMA}_{\text{slow}}
$$

$$
\text{Signal Line} = \text{EMA}(\text{MACD}, \text{signal period})
$$

- **EMA_fast:** Exponential Moving Average for a short period (e.g., 12 days).
- **EMA_slow:** Exponential Moving Average for a long period (e.g., 26 days).
- **Signal Period:** Typically a 9-day EMA of the MACD.

### 3. Relative Strength Index (RSI)

RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between zero and 100.

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{RSI} = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + \text{RS}}
$$

$$
\text{RS} = \frac{\text{Average Gain over 'n' periods}}{\text{Average Loss over 'n' periods}}
$$

- **Average Gain/Loss:** The average of the gains/losses over the past 'n' periods (typically 14).

### 4. Bollinger Bands

Bollinger Bands are a volatility indicator that consists of a middle SMA along with an upper and lower band.

**Calculation:**

- **Middle Band:** 20-day simple moving average (SMA) of the closing prices.
- **Upper Band:** Middle band + (2 x standard deviation of price over last 20 days).
- **Lower Band:** Middle band - (2 x standard deviation of price over last 20 days).

### 5. Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

VWAP is the average price a stock has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price.

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{VWAP} = \frac{\sum (\text{Price} \times \text{Volume})}{\sum \text{Volume}}
$$

- **Price:** The stock's trading price at each interval.
- **Volume:** The number of shares traded at each interval.

### 6. Stochastic Oscillator

A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time.

**Calculation:**

$$
\%K = \frac{(\text{Current Close} - \text{Lowest Low})}{(\text{Highest High} - \text{Lowest Low})} \times 100
$$

$$
\%D = \text{3-period moving average of \%K}
$$

- **Current Close:** The most recent closing price.
- **Lowest Low:** The lowest price traded of the stock over the past 'n' periods.
- **Highest High:** The highest price traded of the stock over the past 'n' periods.
- **n:** Typically set to 14 periods.

### 7. Average Directional Index (ADX)

The ADX is used to measure the strength of a trend. The higher the ADX value, the stronger the trend.

**Calculation:**
First, calculate the Directional Movement Indicators (+DI and -DI), then compute the ADX.

$$
\text{ADX} = \frac{\text{Smoothed Moving Average of Absolute Value of (+DI - -DI)}}{\text{Average of +DI and -DI}}
$$

- **+DI:** Positive Directional Indicator.
- **-DI:** Negative Directional Indicator.
- **The smoothing period is typically 14 days.**

#### Price Volume Factors

Certainly, price-volume related factors are crucial in technical analysis as they combine both price movement and trading volume to offer insights into market trends and investor sentiment. Here are some common price-volume related factors and their calculations:

### 1. On-Balance Volume (OBV)

OBV is a momentum indicator that uses volume flow to predict changes in stock price.

**Calculation:**

- Start with an arbitrary number (e.g., zero) for the initial OBV.
- If today's closing price is higher than yesterday's closing price, then: $\text{Current OBV} = \text{Previous OBV} + \text{Today's Volume}$
- If today's closing price is lower than yesterday's closing price, then: $\text{Current OBV} = \text{Previous OBV} - \text{Today's Volume}$
- If today's closing price is equal to yesterday's closing price, then: $\text{Current OBV} = \text{Previous OBV}$

### 2. Volume-Price Trend (VPT)

VPT is similar to OBV but takes into account the percentage change in price.

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{VPT} = \text{Previous VPT} + \text{Volume} \times \frac{\text{Today's Price Change}}{\text{Previous Closing Price}}
$$

### 3. Accumulation/Distribution Line (A/D Line)

The A/D Line is a volume-based indicator designed to measure the cumulative flow of money into and out of a security.

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{A/D Line} = \text{Previous A/D Line} + \text{Money Flow Volume}
$$

$$
\text{Money Flow Volume} = \text{Money Flow Multiplier} \times \text{Volume for the Period}
$$

$$
\text{Money Flow Multiplier} = \frac{(\text{Close} - \text{Low}) - (\text{High} - \text{Close})}{(\text{High} - \text{Low})}
$$

### 4. Price Volume Trend (PVT)

PVT is an indicator that combines price and volume to give a cumulative line that shows the direction of the trend.

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{PVT} = \text{Previous PVT} + \text{Volume} \times \frac{\text{Current Close} - \text{Previous Close}}{\text{Previous Close}}
$$

### 5. Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)

The CMF combines price and volume to measure the buying and selling pressure over a set period.

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{CMF} = \frac{\sum (\text{Money Flow Volume over 20 periods})}{\sum (\text{Volume over 20 periods})}
$$

$$
\text{Money Flow Volume} = \text{Volume} \times \frac{\text{Close - Low} - \text{High - Close}}{\text{High - Low}}
$$

### 6. Volume Oscillator

The Volume Oscillator measures the difference between two moving averages of volume.

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{Volume Oscillator} = \text{Fast Moving Average of Volume} - \text{Slow Moving Average of Volume}
$$

- The fast and slow moving averages are typically set at periods like 5 and 10 days, or 14 and 28 days.

### 7. Volume Relative Strength Index (Volume RSI)

Similar to the traditional RSI but uses volume instead of price changes.

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{Volume RSI} = 100 - \frac{100}{1 + \text{RS}}
$$

$$
\text{RS} = \frac{\text{Average Volume on Up Days over 'n' periods}}{\text{Average Volume on Down Days over 'n' periods}}
$$

- **n:** Typically 14 periods.

Each of these indicators can offer insights into market dynamics when used in technical analysis. They are particularly useful for identifying trends, reversals, and for confirming price movements. As with all technical analysis tools, they are most effective when used in conjunction with other indicators and methods.
